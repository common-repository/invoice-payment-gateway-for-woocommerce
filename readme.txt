**Add an invoice payment gateway to your WooCommerce website - Give customers the alternative to making immediate payments.**

**Invoice payment gateway for WooCommerce** gives you the power to add an alternative payment process for B2B customers enabling your WooCommerce store to accept invoice payments instead of immediate payments.

[Invoice Payment Gateway For Woocommerce extension](https://wpexperts.io/products/invoice-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce/) adds an invoice payment gateway to your store’s checkout page that generates invoice numbers against orders (usually in bulk quantities) that do not require immediate payment.
